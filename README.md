- 👋 Hi, I’m @NGottschewsky
- 👀 I’m interested in computational psychiatry and using machine learning to predict phenotype characteristics from large sets of neuroimaging data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about computational modelling as a theory driven approach to computational psychiatry.
- 💞️ I’m finishing my master's degree in Neural and Behavioural Sciences at the Graduate Training Center of Neuroscience in Tübingen soon and will start a PhD with the Max Planck School of Cognition in September 2023
