- 👋 Hi, I’m @NGottschewsky
- 👀 I’m interested in computational psychiatry and using machine learning to predict phenotype characteristics from large sets of neuroimaging data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about computational modelling as a theory driven approach to computational psychiatry.
- 💞️ I’m finishing my master's degree in Neural and Behavioural Sciences at the Graduate Training Center of Neuroscience in Tübingen soon and am looking 
       to start a PhD withing the next months. If you happen to be looking for a PhD student and think our interests align, feel free to get in touch with me!
